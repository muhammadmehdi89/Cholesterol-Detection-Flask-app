# Cholesterol-Detection-Flask-app
Assessing lipid-profile Report using Machine Learning, by extracting text from report and making recommendations.
The objective of this project is to develop a lipid-profile medical report assessor that is capable of extracting readings from medical reports and will give you results that on which level of Cholesterol you are such as High Cholesterol, Boderline Cholesterol, and Normal Cholesterol. Based on these results it will also give you recommendations regarding regular exercise and medications. This system aims to enhance healthcare accessibility and efficiency by providing personalized health guidance. So from now there is no need to go to the doctor when you get your lipid-profile report you can scan you document image from this website and get insights.

## Major Functions:
1. Accurate extraction and interpretation of medical report readings. Utilizing OCR Text Recognition technique for precise identifications of parameters.
2. Used Deep Neural Network(DNN) for predictions of multiple classes: High Cholesterol, Boderline Cholesterol, and Normal Cholesterol and achieve accuracy of more than 95%.
3. Personalized health recommendations: Tailoring exercise regimens, medication suggestions and prescriptions based on individual health data.

### Note:
Currently, this model is only applicable to Dow Lab Lipid-Profile Reports. However, I aim to expand its applicability to other labs in the future and incorporate additional diseases into the application.
